playtonia_dm_practice_threaded

1. Every user who connects to playtonia server can play only 1 hour in this server unless they are subscribed users.
2. So you need to check in playtonia db that if the user is a subscribed member.
3. Need to cvars where we can set below mentioned values in server.cfg and it will be flexible. "sm_maxtimesub" - "60" (Where we can assign a value to how much time a subscibed user can play) "sm_maxtimeureg" - "10" (Where we can assign a value to how much time unregistered user can play)
